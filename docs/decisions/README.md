# Architecture decision records

**Rev:** 1

An ADR records a choice that took a **trade study**: real alternatives, analysed against each other.
A decision that did not need that analysis is a convention, and belongs in the document that governs
its subject, not here. New ADR: copy
[`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md), take the lowest free number, and add it to the table.

**An ADR is versioned, not frozen.** Merged text is revisable, and a correction is a new rev rather
than a block appended to the old text. The rev is in the ADR's head, with one line per rev in its
*Revisions* section; prior text is in git. Nothing bounds when a rev is permitted — that is a
judgement call.

**A rev that changes what was chosen moves the `Decided` date with it**, because that date is when
the choice was taken, not when the work merged. A rev that changes only how the decision is stated
leaves it.

**A citation pins a rev** — `ADR NNNN rev M`, never bare, and a link to an ADR is titled the same
way. Revving an ADR therefore reaches every document citing it, each of which is then updated or
re-decided rather than left to age silently. A *Revisions* line pins the rev it names deliberately,
and is the one exemption. **Write an illustrative example with `NNNN`, never a live number** —
nothing distinguishes an example from a citation, so a real number in one is held to that ADR's
current rev and breaks when it revs.

**Supersession is expressed through revving.** The replacing ADR lands alongside, and the replaced
one takes a rev whose *Revisions* line records `superseded by ADR NNNN rev M` — wholly, with
`Status:` flipped, or in the named part. A decision simply gone is `deprecated`.

**Numbers are contiguous and reusable.** Where documents merge, the freed numbers return to the pool.
A number identifies a document rather than a moment: a squash commit on `main` naming one cannot be
amended, so a number in git history need not mean what it means here.
