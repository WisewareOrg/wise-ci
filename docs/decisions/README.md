# Architecture decision records

**Rev:** 1

An ADR captures a decision **with a rejected alternative** — the "why not the other way" is the whole
point of writing one down. A decision with no real alternative considered is a changelog entry and
belongs in a commit message, not here. New ADR: copy [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md), take the lowest
free number, and add it to the table.

**An ADR is versioned, not frozen.** Merged text is revisable, and a correction is a new rev rather
than a block appended to the old text. The rev is in the ADR's head, with one line per rev in its
*Revisions* section; prior text is in git. Nothing bounds when a rev is permitted — that is a
judgement call.

**A rev that changes what was chosen moves the `Decided` date with it**, because that date is when
the choice was taken, not when the work merged. A rev that changes only how the decision is stated
leaves it.

**A citation pins a rev** — `ADR NNNN rev M`, never bare, and a link to an ADR is titled the same
way. Revving an ADR therefore reaches every document citing it, each of which is then updated or
re-decided rather than left to age silently. A *Revisions* line pins the rev it names deliberately,
and is the one exemption. **Write an illustrative example with `NNNN`, never a live number** —
nothing distinguishes an example from a citation, so a real number in one is held to that ADR's
current rev and breaks when it revs.

**Supersession is expressed through revving.** The replacing ADR lands alongside, and the replaced
one takes a rev whose *Revisions* line records `superseded by ADR NNNN rev M` — wholly, with
`Status:` flipped, or in the named part. A decision simply gone is `deprecated`.

**Numbers are contiguous and reusable.** Where documents merge, the freed numbers return to the pool.
A number identifies a document rather than a moment: a squash commit on `main` naming one cannot be
amended, so a number in git history need not mean what it means here.

**An owner ruling carries its attribution.** Where this document records a decision as settled — the
choice itself, or the disposition of a rejected alternative — an owner's ruling is marked
`(owner, YYYY-MM-DD)`, or by a direct quote, at the point it was ruled. An unattributed decision is
the recording author's reasoning, not an owner ruling; nothing else distinguishes a settled ruling
from a session's proposal, so the marker is what a later reader relies on.

| # | Rev | Decided | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| [0001](0001-shape-of-wise-ci.md) | 1 | 2026-09-27 | wise-ci is one repo of composite actions, one per check in its own top-level folder, one version tag for the whole repo, consumed by commit-SHA pin bumped by Renovate; a check's tests live beside it and replace the prose case record; wise-ci gates itself as each check migrates in; maintained tools are shared as config presets, not wrapped |
